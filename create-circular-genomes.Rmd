```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load the necessary packages
```{r packages}
library(circlize)
```

Next step, we will generate a plain graph to see what we need to alter.

```{r first}
circos.initializeWithIdeogram()
text(0, 0, "default", cex = 1)
circos.info()
circos.clear()
```

Things that I want to change:  
* Space between the chromosomes;  
* Start on chromosome 1;  
* Add points to correct places;  
* #Any other alterations will be added here with info  

Start altering the location and space

```{r local-space}
circos.par("start.degree" = 90)
circos.par("gap.degree" = rep(c(2, 4), 12))
circos.initializeWithIdeogram()
circos.clear()
```
